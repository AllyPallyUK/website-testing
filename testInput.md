## Alex's Addition Helper!

Here is an addition helper.
Or just call it Ah, for A (Addition), H (Helper)

Now all you need to do is just write in these little boxes beneath me.
Which numbers would you like to add?

<input type="Number 1" id="num1" name="num1name"/>
<input type="Number 2" id="num2" name="num2name"/>
